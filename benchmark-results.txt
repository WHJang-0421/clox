question 1:
before optimization:
- control flow: 1.52578 seconds
- functions: 3.06719 seconds

after optimization:
- control flox: 1.28919 seconds
- functions: 3.107 seconds

it seems like the optimization is worth it, not in function calls but in control flow.

question 3:
before runtime error for native functions:
- sqrt-example 0.945847
- functions: 2.76894
after runtime error for native functions:
- sqrt-example: 0.917944
- fucntions: 2.90101
It's strange that sqrt-example gets better after adding runtime error. It seems like it's because the variation in runtime.
